[x] - Create a Java Spring Boot application package and make it into
    a docker container that can run the application. Then reload the 
    container if there are any changes.

[x] - Wrote a README.md file explaining what is this project all about
    and what are the langauges, technologies, and tools that I'm going to use
    on this project.

[x] - Implement a basic working GET and POST method. This stage does not have
    a working database, so for now will use a dummy array for storing data.

[ ] - Initialize this project to a git repository.
