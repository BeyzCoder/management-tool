This project is to train me how to properly create a CRUD method and authentication. The project will consist of a login and register page functionality. Then the user will have two types of account one going to
have an admin page and an employee page. The admin can see all employees,
add employees, edit employee's info, delete employee. For the employee's action,
can see his/her dashboard.
